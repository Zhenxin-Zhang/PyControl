# Welcome to PyControl

Say hello to Py-Control, the ultimate web blocker. üòé

Spending too much time browsing? Py-Control smashes the websites forever. No matter if you switch to another Google account, or use the incognito mode (with guilt), or restart your computer, or delete this Py-Control file... These websites will still be BLOCKED! 

P.S. Let me know if you need to get those websites back, that's still possible ;) email: zhenxinz12@gmail.com


## HOW TO USE:
1. open Terminal
2. type: sudo python3 '<your_file_path>/py_control.py' 
3. input your computer password
4. follow the prompt, inputting your website block list
